## Unbounded Knapsack Problem

1. Rod Cutting
    - Given a rod of length `n` inches and an array of prices that contains prices of all pieces of size smaller than `n`. Determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.
2. Coin Change
    - Given a value `N`, if we want to make change for `N` cents, and we have infinite supply of each of `S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm}` valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesn’t matter.
3. Coin Change II 
    - Given a value `N`, if we want to make change for `N` cents, and we have infinite supply of each of `S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm}` valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins needed to make the change? The order of coins doesn’t matter.
    - Given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money. Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.
4. Maximum Ribbon Cut
    - Given a number array representing the length of ribbons and a number ‘k’. We need to cut these ribbons into ‘k’ pieces such that the total length of these pieces is maximum. Write a method to return the maximum total length of the ‘k’ pieces.
