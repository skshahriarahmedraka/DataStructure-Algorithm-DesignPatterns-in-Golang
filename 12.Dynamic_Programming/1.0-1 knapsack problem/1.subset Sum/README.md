Subset Sum Problem

Given a set of non-negative integers and a value sum, the task is to check if there is a subset of the given set whose sum is equal to the given sum. 

Examples: 

    Input: set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 9
    Output: True
    Explanation: There is a subset (4, 5) with sum 9.

    Input: set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 30
    Output: False
    Explanation: There is no subset that add up to 30.
