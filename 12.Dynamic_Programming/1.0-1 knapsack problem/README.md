##  Knapsack Problem

1. fractional Knapsack Problem
    - one can take fractions of any item
    - can be solved using Greedy Algorithm
2. 0/1 Knapsack Problem (Bounded Knapsack Problem)
    - one can take only one instance of an item
    - can be solved using Dynamic Programming
3. Unbounded Knapsack Problem
    - one can take any number of instances of an item
    - can be solved using Dynamic Programming


## 0/1 Knapsack Problem (Bounded Knapsack Problem)
1. subset Sum
    - if there is two subset of an array whose sum is equal - return true else false
2. Equal sum partition
    - if there is two subset of an array whose sum is equal - return two subset else empty
3. Count of subset sum
    - count of subset of an array whose sum is equal to given sum 
4. Minimum Subset Sum Diff
    - find the minimum difference between two subset of an array
5. Target Sum
    - assign `+` or `-` sign to each element of an array and make the sum equal to given target sum
6. Number of Subset Sum of given Difference
    - count of subset of an array whose difference of sum of two subset is equal to given difference
